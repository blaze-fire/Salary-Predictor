Covid-19 has impacted our lives greatly but more so has impacted source of income of many, as if things were already not difficult.
As an engineering student currently in my 2nd year, i would be sitting for my internships soon,  it would be great to have an idea what skills are trending in tech industry, to boost my chances of getting good internships and eventually a good job, in this project, I predict salaries based on the skills, company names, requirements and rating of the company posted in indeed ([best job searching site](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/top-best-job-websites-2064080)), for which i scraped the site using [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) library.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Jupyter notebook version: 6.1.3
* Spyder version:  4.2.1
* Python version: 3.8

## Model Building

**[Python File](https://github.com/blaze-fire/Salary-Predictor/blob/main/model%20building/model.py)**

First started with basic regression models like <b>Lasso</b>  as the data has outliers and lasso is robust to outliers.

Also some really powerful models like <b>Random forest</b>, <b>ExtraTrees</b>, <b>Gradient boosted trees</b> and <b>Xgboost</b> models were used  as the complexity of problem is high but the available data is small. (784 training and 100 test examples) <br>

Also created a blender of best models, to squeeze a bit more performance from the models

*For stacking RandomForest, XGBRegressor, ExtraTrees, GradientBoosting, VotingRegressor were used as they performed the best*

## Results

|Sno.| Model      				    |	Mean Squared Error 	|
| ----|   :-----------: 				| 		----------- 				|
|	1	| Lasso       		    		|   719235.0548   			|
|	2	| DecisionTree 			| 	390581.141        		|
|	2	| SVR 							| 	648245.439        		|
|	3	| RandomForest			|   355811.3915   	 		|
|	4	| XGBRegressor  		| 	416166.7595        	|
|	5	| ExtraTrees   				| 	438762.352        		|
|	6	| GradientBoosting  	|	498879.956        		|
|	7	| VotingRegressor   	|   402993.457   			|
|	8	| Stacking Ensemble 	|   363761.364   			|


**Note:**	*The MSE of all models are on test set.* 

The **R2** score from Stacking Ensemble model predictions is **0.5201**, the model explains half of the observed variation, which is acceptable if not great. (only 784 training and 100 test examples) 
The model can give much better predictions if fed with more data.
